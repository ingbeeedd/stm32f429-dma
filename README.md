# stm32f429-dma

Hello, this repository will cover DMA tutorial based ARM Cortex-M(STM32F4) in general and provide documentation of practices for controlling ARM cortex-M DMA. 

Programmatically, we're going to deal with low levels, and the board's targeting the stm32f429-discovery

Finally, I captured the contents of the dma project based on the ov2640 camera (fmc, sdram, dcmi, etc)

Development environment

1. Window 10
2. Keil MDK 5 or System Workbench for STM32
3. STM32F429-Discovery1

Thank you
